## Projects

Here is a summary of the projects included in this repository.

### 1. Simple Autocorrect Tool

* **Status:** ✅ Completed
* **Description:** A command-line tool built from scratch that takes a sentence with spelling errors and provides a corrected version. It identifies misspelled words and suggests the most likely correction based on Levenshtein distance.
* **Technologies Used:**
    * Python 3
    * Jupyter Notebook
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    * Vocabulary building from a text corpus
    * Edit Distance (Levenshtein distance algorithm)

### 2. AI-Powered Translator App

* **Status:** ⏳ In Progress
* **Description:** A real-time translation application powered by a state-of-the-art Transformer model. This project leverages pre-trained models from the Hugging Face library to perform high-quality translations between languages.
* **Technologies to be Used:**
    * Python 3
    * Jupyter Notebook
    * Hugging Face `transformers` library
    * PyTorch
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Machine Translation
    * Transformer Models (Sequence-to-Sequence architecture)
    * Transfer Learning
